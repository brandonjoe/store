General use: This project was made to my sister's etsy [store](https://www.etsy.com/shop/peachesandcherries). It was built with React and includes a shopping cart, along with different sizes for the rings being sold. It uses Paypal api, and uses a Firebase backend to store orders for the owner to see. After purchasing, there is a confirmation screen with a review of the items bought. Contact info is currently being handled through formspree. The site is responsive. 

Future plans: I plan to make the price calculations on a real backend so that the user can't manipulate the files. As of right now, there is only paypal, but I plan to use other forms of payment, but through the use of their API (Applepay for example). I do want to learn PHP to have a proper contact form, as of right now it uses Formspree.
