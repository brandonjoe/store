# E-Commerce store

 This project was made to my sister's etsy [store](https://www.etsy.com/shop/peachesandcherries). It was built with React and includes a shopping cart, along with different sizes for the rings being sold. It uses Paypal api, and uses a Firebase backend to store orders for the owner to see. After purchasing, there is a confirmation screen with a review of the items bought. Contact info is currently being handled through formspree. 

### General use 

You can add rings to the cart, along the the appropriate sizes. You technically can buy items from this store, and the order will be sent to the backend, as well as money will be taken from your account. But I recommend you don't buy anything as you can just buy from her actual etsy store if you're interested (you'll feel a lot more secure). Also, your browser probably won't let you click the paypal button because your browser doesn't trust a paypal transaction from the github site. I've included a gif of what the process would look like.

### Future use

I plan to make the price calculations on a real backend so that the user can't manipulate the files. As of right now, there is only paypal, but I plan to use other forms of payment, but through the use of their API (Applepay for example). I do want to learn PHP to have a proper contact form, as of right now it uses Formspree.
